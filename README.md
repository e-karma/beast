How to SANE
==========================
### [Demo](http://howtosane.ninja)

The official demo app of how to use the [SANE stack](https://github.com/artificialio/sane). This is also the main experiment laboratory for prototyping and spinning off sane add ons.

Please keep in mind that this project is 'canary'. For the sake of adopting new features as early as possible,  it is developed using the latest unstable versions of everything like ember canary, es6, iojs etc. This will definitely cause instability.

Currently demonstrated features:

+ CRUD - API with a SPA client
+ User authentication
+ Data relationships
+ File uploads
+ Photo gallery and viewer
+ Server connected UI components
+ Data bound modals
+ Basic CMS
+ Geo data and mapping
+ Many more coming

Open to contributors
